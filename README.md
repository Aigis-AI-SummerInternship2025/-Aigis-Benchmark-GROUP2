## Objectives

- Reproduce one or two well-established structural defect detection models from recent literature (e.g., DeepCrack, YOLOv8) to provide reliable performance baselines.
- Standardize and format the Aigis dataset to ensure a fair, reproducible model comparison.
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics: precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
- Conduct both quantitative and qualitative analysis to explore strengths, weaknesses, and failure cases.
- Provide evidence-based recommendations to improve the Aigis model and inform future development.
